# NearestPair
Implementation of algorithms to find the closest pair of points in a set in two dimensional space.

During the Cartesian Seminar of University Potsdam we took a look into Probabilistic Algorithms (1976) by M. O. Rabin.
This repository aims to implement some approaches mentioned in the paper for the sake of better understanding and comparism.
